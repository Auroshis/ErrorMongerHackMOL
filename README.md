# Error Monger

## Web application that will help developers to 

 - Keep track of errors they encounter during development cycle add solutions/solution links, remarks, code snippets.
 - Keep count of them to see which kind of errors you are committing frequently.
 

## The problem we are solving

 - Save time of developers in fixing errors by reducing redundant research work.
 - Give insights about the frequently occuring errors so that the developer can check which kind of errors he/she is commiting often.

## Future scope

 - Make a plugin which can be integrated with text editors to make it easy for developers to add errors in the text editors itself.
 - Give suggestion/remarks to fix an error in the text editor.

With 26 million active developers in 2021 around the globe[(Global developer population 2024 | Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/627312/worldwide-developer-population/)), we are optimistic for a win-win situation.
