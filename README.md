## Web application that will help developers to keep track of errors they encounter during development cycle, add solutions/solution links, remarks, code snippets and keep count of them to see which kind of errors you are committing frequently. With 26 million active developers [(Global developer population 2024 | Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/627312/worldwide-developer-population/)), we are optimistic for a win-win situation.
